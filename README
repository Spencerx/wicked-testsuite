wicked-testsuite
================

This is the test suite used for Continuous Integration of development
of the Wicked network interfaces broker.

Tests are written in plain English and run with Cucumber test engine.

Jenkins can be used as a build and test scheduler,
but it is not mandatory.

The test suite relies on Twopence remote execution engine.

The test model assumes there are four machines:
o the machine from which you run the tests
o the machine on which you build the Wicked RPMs
o "sut", the system under test
o "reference", the partner of "sut", answering pings,
  running DHCP and RADVD servers, etc.

These machines can be real or virtual. If you use Virtual Machines,
configuration files for QEmu/KVM are provided.

The test machines can be distinct or merged, with the constraint
that "sut" and "reference" must be distinct.

For more details about the installation, see README.setup.
For more details about the tests themselves, see README.tests.


Happy testing!
