    <h1>How to run a test scenario for Wicked manually</h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you'd like to run a test in isolation and with
      more flexibility than the web interface.
      <ol>
        <li>ssh to the server: <br />
          <tt>$ ssh jenkins@jung.arch.suse.de</tt></li>
        <li>If there are some tests already running,
          either wait for them to finish, or stop the job in Jenkins.<br />
          Sometimes, when you stop the job in Jenkins, the <tt>cucumber</tt>
          process does <b>not</b> get stopped, and you have to kill it manually
          as <tt>root</tt> user.</li>
        <li>Once you are sure you are alone, go to the official test suites directory: <br />
          <tt>cd cucumber</tt></li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that Wicked has already been built for some test suite,
      but that we virtual machines are stopped, for example after a successful
      test, you can start them with a dedicated helper script:</br />
      <tt>$ jenkins-files/start-vms.sh wicked-master 1</tt><br />
      The first argument is the name of the test suite, and the second argument
      its numeric identificator.<br />
      The virtual machines and networks are created out of default images,
      and latest wicked built in that project is copied into the virtual machines.
      If you don't want to use default images, copy and modify the script.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the virtual machines are started (they always are after failed tests),
      you can run a test scenario in isolation:.
      <ol>
        <li>Define the needed environment variables:<br/>
          <tt>$ export TARGET_SUT=virtio:/var/run/twopence/sut-wicked-master</tt><br />
          <tt>$ export TARGET_REF=virtio:/var/run/twopence/ref-wicked-master</tt></li>
          Then run the scenario, for example:<br />
          <tt>$ cucumber -n "Set up a second card"</tt></li>
      </ol>
      It will use the same version of Wicked that
      was last built and tested in the web interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      To debug potential problems, you can vnc to the virtual machines:
      <ol>
        <li>reference: <tt>jung.arch.suse.de</tt> port <tt>5900</tt> + test suite identificator</li>
        <li>sut: <tt>jung.arch.suse.de</tt> port <tt>6000</tt> + test suite identificator</li>
        <li>identificators:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>1</tt> = wicked-master</li>
            <li><tt>2</tt> = wicked-master-nanny</li>
            <li><tt>3</tt> = wicked-testing</li>
            <li><tt>4</tt> = wicked-testing-nanny</li>
            <li><tt>5</tt> = wicked-sle12</li>
            <li><tt>6</tt> = wicked-sle12-nanny</li>
            <li>playground: add 6</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Most of the time, you will probably want to vnc to sut.<br />
      Once there, log in as <tt>root</tt> or as <tt>testuser</tt>.
      If you logged in as <tt>root</tt>, you will be in a <tt>screen</tt> interface;
      open a new virtual screen with Ctrl-A c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of using vnc, you can use virt-manager, or virsh console.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy debugging!
