## Description:	Global DHCP client configuration
#
# Note: 
# To configure one or more interfaces for DHCP configuration, you have to
# change the BOOTPROTO variable in /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-<interface>
# to 'dhcp' (and possibly set STARTMODE='onboot'). 
#
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.
#
# Note: NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.

## Type: list("",yes,no,first)
## Default: ""
#
# Multiple DHCP clients:
#
# With two or more DHCP clients running, they would concurrently try to replace
# the default route or set the hostname. There are several ways of dealing with
# this conflict (and it is a conflict, because you can have only one default
# route even though routes are stackable and the dhcp clients would change it
# while every lease renew):
#
#  1) Allow both clients to do that stuff. This would work in many cases if
#     only one of the interfaces is used at a time. However, it would lead to
#     undefined behaviour such as changing default route e.g. on dhcp renew.
#
#  2) When both interfaces are connected to the same network, you may configure
#     a bonding interface in active-backup mode (or another, e.g. 802.3ad, when
#     supported and configured by the switch) and configure dhcp on the bonding
#     instead.
#
#  3) When only one of the interfaces is used at time, you may set STARTMODE to
#     ifplugd and specify the priority of the interfaces in IFPLUGD_PRIORITY.
#     This is a common scenario for notebooks to use the wired interface when
#     connected, wireless otherwise.
#
#  4) allow only one of the DHCP clients to do that stuff.
#     This implies that there would be a "primary" interface and a "secondary".
#     This is the assumption the default configuration is based on. But since
#     the system often can't guess which interface is "more important", we
#     simply choose one depending on related configuration or take the first
#     interface that is started with DHCP to be primary ("authoritative").
#     This can be configured by setting DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=yes in one of
#     the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-* files and DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=no
#     in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp (or in all other ifcfg files using DHCP).
#
# When DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE is not explicitly configured to yes/no, the
# "primary" interface is choosed as follows:
#
# - On systems with iSCSI Boot Firmare Table, the iBFT primary interface
#   is used as the primary DHCP interface by default.
# - On systems booting via PXE, the interface specified by the BOOTIF kernel
#   parameter is used as primary DHCP interface. Set the global "ipappend 2"
#   parameter in pxelinux.cfg/* files, so the BOOTIF kernel parameter is set.
# - Otherwise, the DHCP client that is started first will be "primary" and
#   allowed the set the default route and hostname ("first up wins" mode,
#   the only one before openSUSE 11.4). To force this "first up wins" mode,
#   set DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE="first" in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp.
#
# All other running dhcp clients will only configure the interface with an
# address and network routes, but not change the "global" default route or
# hostname.
# See also DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE and DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME variables,
# that allow to modify the DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE parameter behaviour once
# again.
#
# Thus, to specifically allow an interface's DHCP client to change "global"
# configuration, set the following variable to "yes". Or you can make an
# interface's DHCP client never change these settings if you set it to "no".
# If you leave it empty then ifup-dhcp will decide.

# Should the DHCP client set the hostname? (yes|no)

# When it is likely that this would occur during a running X session, 
# your DISPLAY variable could be screwed up and you won't be able to open
# new windows anymore, then this should be "no". 
#
# If it happens during booting it won't be a problem and you can 
# safely say "yes" here. For a roaming notebook with X kept running, "no"
# makes more sense.

## Type:	yesno

#
# specifies a string used for the hostname option field when dhcp client
# sends DHCP messages. Some DHCP servers will update nameserver entries 
# (dynamic DNS).
# Also, some DHCP servers, notably those used by @Home Networks, require
# the hostname option field containing a specific string in the DHCP
# messages from clients.
#
# By default the current hostname is sent ("AUTO"), if one is defined in 
# /etc/HOSTNAME. 
# Use this variable to override this with another hostname, or leave empty
# to not send a hostname.

DHCLIENT_HOSTNAME_OPTION="AUTO"

## Type:	string

# WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES variable -- it is adjusted to WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES/2
# as default.

#
# If set, then the hostname is added to /etc/hosts with IP address
# 127.0.0.2. This allows the hostname to be resolved (and thus, the
# host to be reached), if the real network is not reachable.
#
# On the another side, it causes that the hostname is then never
# resolved via DNS, but always from /etc/hosts and points to the
# 127.0.0.2 address. This may (will) also break some software,
# trying to resolve own hostname instead to use getifaddrs(3).
